# Git Basics
- [x] Basic git commands

## Getting code from GitHub
1. **Cloning** -- copy everything from a git server onto your own computer with `git clone <enter a git repo url>`
2. **Pulling** -- grab the latest changes from a repo you are already connected to with `git pull`

## Steps to bring your code to GitHub
1. **Staging** -- stage all your changes with `git add .`
2. **Commit** -- commit your changes with `git commit -m "i did something."`
3. **Push** -- upload your commits to the server `git push`

## Standards
- [x] Always pull before you start coding to avoid conflicts
- [x] Make sure your commits are somewhat *descriptive*
